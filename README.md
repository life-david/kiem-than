# 🗡️ Azure Cloud Sword Array

🔥 **Cyber Cultivation Simulator Hand-Crafted by Gemini 3.0!**

## 🎮 How to Play? (Core Gameplay)

Turn on your camera and reach out your hand! The system will recognize your gestures to control the sword array:

| Gesture | Action Description | Skill Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **👈 Sword Finger** | Extend index finger (or gun gesture) | **Roaming Dragon**: The flying swords turn into a roaming dragon, dancing along with your fingertip. |
| **✋ Open Palm** | Open five fingers naturally | **Lotus Manifestation**: Ten thousand swords return to the origin, forming a blooming sword lotus. |
| **✊ Fist** | Clench your fist | **Sword Shield**: Flying swords rotate at high speed, forming an absolute defense barrier. |
| **🤘 Rock Gesture** | Extend index + little finger | **Grand Geng Sword Array**: [High Energy Warning] Summon a heaven-reaching magic circle and giant swords! |

> **💡 Tips**:
> *   Please ensure sufficient ambient light so the camera can see your hand clearly.
> *   When playing on mobile, remember to rotate your screen to landscape for better effect! (Supports automatic portrait/landscape adaptation)
